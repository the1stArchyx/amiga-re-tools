* Tools to aid in reverse engineering of software for the classic AmigaOS

This repository will contain tools I'll be writing to convert certain
loadable file formats into the form that they would be loaded into the
memory of the computer by the operating system itself.


** UnUhunker

The first functional tool is ~UnHunker~ to convert "Hunk" format
executables the way the AmigaOS would do. This allows creating a
statically addressed memory dump segment to be loaded into Ghidra or
another reverse engineering tool for further processing.

Currently it handles HUNK_CODE and HUNK_RELOC32 hunks to produce a
statically addressed monolith. Any hunks to be loaded to chip RAM will
be addressed below 0x100000, other hunks starting from that same 1Â MB
boundary. The base address to load the dump is appended to the file
name while the entry point should in most cases stay at 0x100000.

I'm aware that this could be made as a plugin for Ghidra, but
maintaining it to keep it up-to-date with Ghidra would be too much of
a chore for me.


** Future

Another project could be an ADF tool to work on Amiga Disk File
images. Initially the target will be to be compatible with disk images
that have a partial OFS file system with custom blocks of data. This
has been seen on some floppies of games that start through the
operating system but subsequently load the game data with a custom
trackloader.
